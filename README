# ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY
The Forward-Forward algorithm is an algorithm proposed by Jeffrey Hinton at NeurISP in December 2022.  
This algorithm differs from conventional neural networks in that it learns without using the error back propagation method.  
I implemented the Forward-Forward algorithm using **Tensorflow.**  
  
I am a Japanese student studying about neural networks. Therefore, **all comments and docstrings in the code are in Japanese.**  
Also, as of January 18, 2023, the code has received little feedback. Therefore, there may possibly be mistakes or inefficiencies.  
If you find them, please comment!
